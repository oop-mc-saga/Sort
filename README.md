# Sorting lists
- Simple sort methods such as merge sort
- Using `Comparable` interface
- Extracting superclasses

# Packages
## `example0`
The first example of sorting.
- `MergeSort.java`: The simple implementation of merge sort method
- `Student.java`: The target data for sorting.
- `Main0.java`: The main class.
## `example1`
This Introduces `Comparable` interface. 
The details are given at the lecture
## `example2`
This package is for extracting a super class from existing classes. 
The details are given at the lecture.
## `exercise`
## `comparatorExample`
Another way to implement a general sorting method is using the `Comparator` interface.
The `Comparator` interface has `compare()` method.

# Test Packages
## `example0`
This shows a simple example of testing.
The `MergeSort.sort()` method is tested.
